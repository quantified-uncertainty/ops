# Simplified configuration for Argo CD.
# All apps in the following list will be turned into Argo CD Applications.
# If `source` is set, it'll load a remote Helm chart. See https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/helm/ for the supported fields in the `source` section.
# Otherwise, it'll load the `k8s/apps/{name}` dir from this repo.
# (If this sounds confusing, check out the `apps.yaml` template file, and look through Argo CD docs on `Application` resource.)

apps:

# For infra-level apps, `automated: null` is set intentionally to avoid accidents.
# Please sync them via [Argo CD Web UI](https://argo.k8s.quantifieduncertainty.org/) or CLI,
# and check the diffs carefully before sync.
